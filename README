Telegram messenger (you can also use the web version at web.telegram.org)
First part
This part of the seminar (and this branch of GitHub) is the code to set up a bot server to connect to Telegram API via webhook and to respond to some messages with yo mama jokes.

What to do
To get this running, you need the following. First install dependencies

Step 0 : Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/SourravPR/impress.git

Step 1 : Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 2 : Run migrations (optional actually)
Though there are no models for this code, this just creates the default stuff for admin.

python manage.py migrate

Step 3 : Start the local server
And start the server with

python manage.py runserver

Step 4 : Download and use ngrok
You need an HTTPS url for most webhooks for bots to work. For purely development purposes you can use ngrok. It gives a web-accessible HTTPS url that tunnels through to your localhost. Download ngrok (https://ngrok.com/) , got to a new tab on your terminal and start it with

ngrok http 8000

At this point, you will have to add the URLs to ALLOWED_HOSTS in chatbot_tutorial/settings.py.

Step 5 : Talk to the BotFather and get and set your bot token
Start telegram, and search for the Botfather. Talk to the Botfather on Telegram and give the command /newbot to create a bot and follow the instructions to get a token.

Copy the token and paste in chatbot_tutorial/views.py

Step 6 : Set your webhook by sending a post request to the Telegram API
type : https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/setWebhook?url=<ngrok url> in a web browser and press enter
Step 7 : Talk to the bot by starting with /start
